## Description

### Code and design explanation

#### The `main` function

The main function is a simple one that sets up the page configuration and the general layout of the app.
The choice of such a main function was made for the purpose of `seperation of concerns`.
This way, the code is easier to write, read and test.
The functions with the format `col_*_content` contain the UI code and functions calls for each related section and functionality.
